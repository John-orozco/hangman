# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

Add documentation to your GitHub README file. You can refer to the relevant lesson in the prerequisites for this task for more information.
At minimum, your README file should contain the following information:
Project Title : Hangman
Table of Contents : milestone_2, milestone_3, milestone_4, milestone_5
A description of the project: To create the game of Hangman
Milestone_2 : Within the milestone_2 file it will showcase the import of the random module which is one Python's built-in modules. It will have a list of fruits where the users can guess a single letter of the that was pick from the list at random. If the user puts a letter it will reply with a message saying "Good guess!" however, if the users puts a number instead they will a get a message saying "Opp! that is not a valid input".
Milestone_3: In milestone_3 it will have code which will allow the user input a letter and it vaildate for them, to see if they got the right letter.
milestone_4 : In milestone_4 the piece of code will have a lot of attributes that will have to follow certain functional requirements for the game of hangman to work. Furthermore, the code will showcase a loop with condition to true, it will also have, if statement and a elif statement depending on the users input within the game of hangman.
milestone_5 : Lastly, within milestone_5 it will showcase a fully functioning hangman game. which will randomly generate a word from a fruit list where the user can guess the word five times before they are out of life.
